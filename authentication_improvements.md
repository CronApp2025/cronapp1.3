# Authentication System Improvements

## Summary
This document details the improvements made to the authentication system to enhance security and fix issues related to the migration from PostgreSQL to MySQL.

## Fixed Issues

### Database Migration
- Successfully migrated authentication-related database access from PostgreSQL to MySQL
- Updated all SQL queries to be compatible with MySQL syntax
- Ensured proper connection handling and transaction management

### User ID Handling in JWT Tokens
- Fixed "Subject must be a string" error in JWT token generation
- Added explicit conversion of user IDs to strings before token creation:
  ```python
  user_id_str = str(user_data['id'])
  access_token = build_token(user_id=user_id_str, ...)
  refresh_token = create_refresh_token(identity=user_id_str)
  ```

### Password Recovery Flow
- Fixed token validation and database storage
- Added comprehensive validation of password reset tokens
- Implemented secure token storage in database with proper expiration tracking
- Improved error handling and user feedback during password reset process

### Security Enhancements
- Implemented stronger password validation (12+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters)
- Added CSRF protection middleware
- Configured secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Secure)
- Improved database query security to prevent SQL injection
- Enhanced error logging for security events

## Test Results

### Registration
- Successfully tested user registration with strong password requirements
- Validation working correctly for password complexity rules
- User data properly stored in MySQL database

### Login
- Successfully authenticated with both original and reset passwords
- JWT token generation working correctly with string user IDs
- User data properly retrieved and returned in response

### Password Recovery
- Successfully generated and validated password reset tokens
- Email delivery system working correctly (simulated in test environment)
- Password reset successfully updates user credentials
- Token invalidation after use functioning correctly

## Security Considerations
- All passwords are properly hashed using secure algorithms
- Tokens have appropriate expiration times
- API endpoints have proper validation for all inputs
- Error messages are generic to prevent information leakage
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks

## Remaining Work
- Consider adding additional security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection)
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
- Add multi-factor authentication options
- Improve logging for security audits
